(defn paths
  "About:
    Takes a sequence object as its only argument and using the following
    sequence structure specification generates the list of all possible paths
    down nested sequences befitting the spec.

  Sequence Spec:
    [meta & tail]
    All valid argmuent sequences S to this function will begin with a Clojure
    symbol which signifies whether the elements of the list represent alternate
    paths through the list or whether they represent a sequence to be included
    literally which may require recursion to expand into a full path.
    
    Valid Symbols:
      :seq - indicates that the list is a sequence which should be included but
             checked for recursion into other subtrees.

      :alt - indicates that the list is a sequence of sequences only one of
             which can be correctly included.

  Note:
    The nil literal if encountered in a sequence represents that an empty edge
    is a valid case of that sequence and causes nothing to be added to the path
    when evaluated.

  Example:
  (seq-paths [:seq :a [:alt :b1 :b2 :b3] :c [:seq :d [:alt :e1 nil]]])
  => [(:a :b1 :c :d :e1)
      (:a :b1 :c :d)
      (:a :b2 :c :d :e1)
      (:a :b2 :c :d)
      (:a :b3 :c :d :e1)
      (:a :b3 :c :d)]"
